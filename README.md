Hi There! I'm Rabin. ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ”­

I am a 4th-year Ph.D. student in [Computer Science](https://www.uh.edu/nsm/computer-science/) at the [University of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/). My research advisor is [Dr. Amin Alipour](https://www.aminalipour.com/) and I am a member of the [Software Engineering Research Group(SERG)](https://uh.edu/serg/). We are mainly working on the area of Machine Learning for Software Engineering. Our goal is to introduce new testing frameworks for evaluating machine (deep) learning models of source code and interpreting how they perform and what key input features they learn from source code.
